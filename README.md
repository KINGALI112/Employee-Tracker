                                    Delete Department
                                    Delete Role
                                    Delete Employee
                                    Quit

        The data has been fetched from MYSQL database using mysql2.0 node package, and the command prompts are being displayed on the screen using the inquirer package as we have previosuly used in the assignments. asciiart-logo node package has been used to display the big logo on the start and quit of application. console table has been used to display the data from the database in the form of tabular view.
